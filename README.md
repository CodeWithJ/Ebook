# Project Info

### Design from Dribble @Igor Fartushny

### Functionality

Currently, there is minor functionality implemented into this project as it is mainly just designed with ReactJS.

### What are the 'Minor Functions'?

1. The 'Keep Reading' card is dynamic, meaning it changes its width according to the pages read of total pages. I.e. ( (readPages/totalPages) * 100 == progressBarWidth ). i.e. (271/300) = ~90%
2. Ahem...and that's pretty much it for the functionality.

### Thoughts on Project
I really enjoyed working on this project. The design was pleasing to the eye and as an avid book reader, I'd enjoy a site like this.

### What I've learned from this Project
1. How awesome Flexbox is...I mean position elements using flexbox is a lot easier than when using floats and the like.
2. I've become more familiar with working with 'props' and their usefulness.
3. Touched up some CSS fundamentals that I've forgotten.
